# Clonal aRt visualization
Visual artsy representation of B-cell clonal repertoires using R.

Script for visual representation of a B-cell clonal repertoire using R. Each non-singleton clone is indicated by a line and represented as a radial plot where the number of elements represents the number of subclones that compose it. Singletons are represented as single points.

Written for my entry at the [Imaging Competition of the Antibody Society](https://www.antibodysociety.org/imaging-competition/).


Inspired by the [work of Ijeamaka Anyene](https://ijeamakaanyene.github.io/aRt_ggplot/index.html). Full libraries and references can be found in the main script.
